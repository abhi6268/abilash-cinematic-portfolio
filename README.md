# 🎬 Abilash Mundlur — Cinematic Developer Portfolio

A bold, Netflix-inspired developer portfolio showcasing real-world engineering work, UI craftsmanship, and product-level thinking.  
Built to feel less like a résumé — and more like a trailer for how I build software.

## 🚀 About This Project

This portfolio is designed as a **cinematic experience** for recruiters and hiring managers.

It highlights:
- How I think about frontend as engineering, not decoration
- How I ship production-grade features under real constraints
- How I balance performance, UX, and clean architecture
- How I take ownership from idea → implementation → delivery

Every interaction, animation, and layout choice is intentional.
